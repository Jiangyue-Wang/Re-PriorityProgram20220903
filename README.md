# Re-PriorityProgram20220903
This repo contains codes and data for priority program, which is under review of One Earth of Cell Press. I need to rerun AOH to generate correct species data to do prioritization.

## Rerun AOH
### Try amphibians first
I have downloaded species range data from [IUCN Red List Resources](https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/spatial-data-download), and get the file [AMPHIBIANS.zip](ReAOH/AMPHIBIANS.zip). Trying to generate AOH using [AmphibianAOH.R](ReAOH/AmphibianAOH.R) code.
